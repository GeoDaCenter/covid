      The U.S. COVID-19 Atlas is a county-level clustering surveillance tool to provide quick access to county-level COVID-19 estimates, longitudinal exploration, and cluster detection. It reveals a more detailed pandemic landscape with local hotspots of surging COVID cases that are missed by state-level data. The Atlas is being updated everyday before 12pm, CT. We are working on releasing regular updates with more data, functions, and analysis.<br><br>

      It was started on Saturday, March 14th 2020 and launched less than two weeks later (on March 27) by the University of Chicago’s Center for Spatial Data Science (CSDS) based on its GeoDaWeb platform. A network of volunteers activated to contribute to its development, and the atlas has since expanded as a research coalition across multiple institutions.  </p>

      <h3 class="text-primary"> Open Source: </h3>
      We are an open source collaborative project, committed to Open Science. All the methods used on this site can be replicated using GeoDa desktop software (also open, free, and cross-platform). The code repository for this site is also an open project and can be accessed at github.com/geoda/covid.<br>

      <h3 class="text-primary"> Research Partners: </h3>
      We are a coalition of research partners and contributors that have been integral to developing and expanding the Covid Atlas to meet the needs of health practitioners, planners, researchers, and the public.
    
        <h4><a href="https://spatial.uchicago.edu/">Center for Spatial Data Science (CSDS)</a> at the University of Chicago</h4> The Atlas was originally developed as a project co-led by <a href="https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directory/marynia-kolak-phd">Marynia Kolak</a>, <a href="https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directories/full/team">Xun Li</a>, and <a href="https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directories/full/team">Qinyun Lin</a> at the Center for Spatial Data Science, where it remains as its home institution. CSDS leads the development and management of the atlas with software engineers <a href="">Robert Martin</a> and <a href="">Arianna Israel</a>.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/people.html">The Yu Group</a> at UC Berkeley’s Department of Statistics</h4>The Yu Group is working with <a href="https://response4life.org/">Response4Life</a> to develop a <a href="https://github.com/Yu-Group/covid19-severity-prediction">severity index</a> for each hospital to help distribute supplies when they become available. The Yu Group generates daily updates of COVID data and contributes both hospital and county-level severity index data for the Atlas.<br>
      
        <h4><a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/">County Health Rankings & Roadmaps</a></h4> 
        CHR&R is directed by <a href="https://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/brown-lawrence/">Lawrence Brown</a>. It's goal is to improve health outcomes for all and to close the health gaps between those with the most and least opportunities for good health. County Health Rankings leads efforts to connect socioeconomic and health vulnerability indicators to the Atlas to better contextualize and inform findings.<br>
      
        <h4><a href="https://spreadinnovation.com/">CSI Solutions</a></h4> 
        The CSI solutions team led by Roger L. Chaufournier and Kathy Reims connects the Atlas with rural health partners across the country to define and prioritize needs for care management during the pandemic. CSI leads efforts in developing and refining this “Communities of Practice” forum.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://datascience.wisc.edu/covid19/">AFI DSI COVID-19 Research Group</a> at UW-Madison</h4>
        This group led by <a href="https://datascience.wisc.edu/covid19">Brian Yandell<a> was an early institutional partner to amplify regional efforts to respond to the pandemic. Kevin Little of <a href="https://www.iecodesign.com/">Informing Ecological Design</a> was critical in connecting the Atlas team with a nationwide network and leading user-group sessions to review the atlas, align priorities, and ensure it was effective for a wide audience. <a href="https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/goldstein-steve/">Steve Goldstein</a> continues to work with our team in data validation efforts.
