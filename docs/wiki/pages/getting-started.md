# Getting Started
### 1/4 Notes

Welcome to the refactored US Covid Atlas. We have greatly expanded the functionality,usability, and portability of the Atlas by refactoring the project into the frontend framework, React.

While we've worked to maintain the general structure of the Atlas, we've introduced a few new features and interface elements we hope will make the Atlas more robust and usable for more people.

<button onClick="test('My String')">test</button>
