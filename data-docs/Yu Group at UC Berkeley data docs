*Data Source(s) Description:*
The Yu group at UC Berkeley Statistics and EECS has compiled, 
cleaned and documented a large corpus of hospital- and county-level 
data from a variety of public sources to aid data science efforts to 
combat COVID-19. At the hospital level, our data include the location 
of the hospital, the number of ICU beds, the total number of employees, 
and the hospital type. At the county level, our data include COVID-19 
cases/deaths from USA Facts and NYT, automatically updated every day, 
along with demographic information, health resource availability, 
COVID-19 health risk factors, and social mobility information. 
An overview of each data set in this corpus is provided in this file.
