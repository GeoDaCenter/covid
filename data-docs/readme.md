# Data Documentation: US Covid Atlas

This folder contains data links and descriptions for all available and archived data for the US Covid Atlas project. The US Covid Atlas aggregates data from a variety of sources to present real-time stats and historic data. No one source or variable holistically captures the pandemic's impact on communities in the US, so providing multi-dimensional snapshots and histories is central to the datasets available on the Atlas.

## Current Datasets

The table below lists the currently available datasets visualized in the Atlas. The Atlas API makes it easy to fetch and analyze data -- data available in the API are marked in the `API Access` column. Links to the in-depth `Data Docs(📄)`, original data publisher `Source Link(🔗)`, and US Covid Atlas `Data Scripts(👩‍💻)` are available for most datasets below.
