### Data Source(s) Description:  
All county level data is sourced from the CDC's [Covid Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/) on the [County](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view) and [Vaccination](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) views. The CDC publishes 7-day rolling average aggregations of testing, case, and death data and daily snapshots of vaccination data.

Both state and county datasets can be joined to Census [Cartographic Boundary Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). The Atlas uses a resolution of 20M.
